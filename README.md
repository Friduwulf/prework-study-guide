# Coding Bootcamp Prework Study Guide

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to get a base level understanding of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, and it was undertaken as both a way to learn the basics, but also to provide me with a tool for study. One that can be added to over time, and in doing so will practice the skills noted within the study guide. By making this project, I have become familiar with the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript, and how they all tie together. I've also learned how to solve problems that arise along the way.
